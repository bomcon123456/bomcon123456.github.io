  Greetings! I am a Research Resident at VinAI Research, where I am fortunate to work under the mentorship of Dr. Anh Tran and Dr. Cuong Pham. My primary research interests focus on Deep Generative Models, including GANs and Diffusion Models.
  
  Previously, I worked as an AI Engineer also at VinAI, gaining hands-on experience in training, deploying, and optimizing deep learning models. During this period, I contributed to projects such as Face Recognition, Traffic Sign and Light Recognition, and Noise Cancelling, mostly deployed on edge devices, bridging the gap between research and real-world applications.
